["machine-setup.html", "Chapter 1 Getting Setup 1.1 Web Browser 1.2 Code Editors 1.3 Bash (Command Line) 1.4 Git and GitHub 1.5 Node and npm Resources", " Chapter 1 Getting Setup This course will cover a wide variety of tools and techniques used in modern web development, including different software programs that are used to write, manage, and execute the code for your web application. This chapter explains how to install and use some of the software you will need to utilize. Note that iSchool lab machines should have all appropriate software already installed and ready to use. 1.1 Web Browser The first thing you’ll need is a web browser for viewing the web pages you make! We recommend you install and utilize Chrome, which comes with an effective set of built-in developer tools that will be especially useful in this class. You can access the Chrome Developer tools by selecting View &gt; Developer &gt; Developer Tools from Chrome’s main menu (Cmd+Option+I on a Mac, Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows). You will almost always want to have these tools open when doing web development, particularly when including interactivity via JavaScript. Other modern browsers such as Firefox or Microsoft Edge will also function in this class and include their own versions of the required development tools. Note that different browsers may and will render code in different ways which will be discussed extensively throughout the course. 1.2 Code Editors In order to write web code, you need somewhere to write it. There are a variety of code editors and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) that are specialized for web development, providing syntax highlighting, code completion, and other useful functionality. There are lots of different code editors out there, all of which have slightly different appearances and features. You only need to download and use one of the following programs (we recommend Visual Studio Code as a default), but feel free to try out different ones to find something you like (and then evangelize about it to your friends!) Visual Studio Code Visual Studio Code (or VS Code; not to be confused with Visual Studio) is a free, open-source editor developed by Microsoft—yes, really. It focuses on web programming and JavaScript, though also supports many other languages and provides a number of community-built extensions for adding even more features. Although fairly new, it is updated regularly and has has become my main editors for programming. VS Code is actually a stand-alone web application, so it’s written in the same HTML, CSS, and JavaScript you’ll learn in this course! To install VS Code, follow the above link and Click the “Download” button to download the installer (e.g, .exe) file, then double-click on that to install the application. Once you’ve installed VS Code, the trick to using it effectively is to get comfortable with the Command Palette. If you hit Cmd+Shift+P, VS Code will open a small window where you can search for whatever you want the editor to do. For example, if you type in markdown you can get list of commands related to Markdown files (including the ability to open up a preview). The Format Code option is particularly useful. For more information about using VS Code, see the documentation, which includes videos if you find them useful. The documentation for programming in HTML, CSS, and especially JavaScript also contain lots of tips and tricks. Atom Atom is a text editor built by the folks at GitHub and has been gaining in popularity. It is very similar to VS Code in terms of features, but has a somewhat different interface and community. It has a similar command-palette to VS Code, and is arguably even nicer about editing Markdown specifically. The document you are reading was authored in Atom. Brackets Brackets is a coding editor authored by Adobe specialized for client-side web developers. It has some intriguing features that are not yet in Visual Studio Code, as well as possibly the nicest interface of this list. Sublime Text Sublime Text is a very popular text editor with excellent defaults and a variety of available extensions (though you’ll need to manage and install extensions to achieve the functionality offered by other editors out of the box). While the software can be used for free, every 20 or so saves it will prompt you to purchase the full version. This is my application of choice for when I just write to write a plain text file. 1.3 Bash (Command Line) Many of the software tools used in professional web development are used on the command-line: a text-based interface for controlling your computer. While the command-line is harder to learn and figure out, it is particularly effective for doing web development. Command-line automation is powerful and efficient enough to handle the dozens of repeated tasks across hundreds of different source files (split across multiple computers) commonly found in web programming. You will need to be comfortable using the command-line in order to utilize the software for this course. While there are multiple different command shells (command line interfaces), this course is based on the Bash shell, which provides a particular common set of commands common to Mac and Linux machines. On a Mac you’ll want to use the built-in app called Terminal. You can open it by searching via Spotlight (hit Cmd (⌘) and Spacebar together, type in “terminal”, then select the app to open it), or by finding it in the Applications/Utilities folder. On Windows, we recommend using Git Bash, which you should install along with git (see below). Open this program to open the command-shell. Note that Windows does come with its own command-prompt, called the DOS Prompt, but it has a different set of commands and features. Powershell is a more powerful version of the DOS prompt if you really want to get into the Windows Management Framework. But Bash is more common in open-source programming like we’ll be doing, and so we will be focusing on that set of commands. Alternatively, the 64-bit Windows 10 Anniversary update (August 2016) does include a beta version of an integrated Bash shell. You can access this by enabling the subsystem for Linux and then running bash in the command prompt. This is currently (May 2017) “beta” technology, but will suffice for our purposes if you can get it running. This course expects you to already be familiar with basic command-line usage. For review, see The Command Line in the INFO 201 course reader. 1.4 Git and GitHub Professional web development involves many different people working on many different files. git is a collaborative version control system that provides a set of commands that allow you to manage changes to written code, particularly when collaborating with other programmers. You will need to download and install the software. If you are on a Mac, git should already be installed. If you are using a Windows machine, then installing git will also install Git Bash, a command shell (described avove). Note that git is a command-line application: you can test that it is installed by running the command: git --version While git is the software used to manage versions of code, GitHub is a website that is used to store copies of computer code that are being managed with git (think “Imgur for code”). In order to use GitHub, you’ll need to create a free GitHub account, if you don’t already have one. You should register a username that is identifiable as you (e.g., based on your name or your UW NetID). This will make it easier for others to determine out who contributed what code, rather than needing to figure out who ‘LeetDesigner2099’ is. This can be the start of a professional account you may use for the rest of your career! Note that you can have git save your GitHub password on your local machine so you don’t have to type it repeatedly. See Authenticating with GitHub from Git. This course expects you to already be familiar with utilizing Git and GitHub. For review, see Git and GitHub and Git Branches and Collaboration in the INFO 201 course reader. Note that students in the INFO 343 course will be using GitHub and Pull Requests to turn in programming assignments. 1.5 Node and npm Node.js (commonly just “Node”) is a a command-line runtime environment for the JavaScript programming language—that is, a program that is used to interpret and execute programming instructions written in JavaScript. Although client-side development usually involves running JavaScript in the browser (see Chapter: JavaScript), Node provides a platform for installing and running a wide variety of “helper” programs that are frequently used in web development. To install Node, visit the download page and select the installer for your operating system (you probably want the .msi for Windows and the .pkg for Mac). For this course you will want to install the latest version of Node (6.10+), so you should update it if you haven’t in a while. Node is a command-line application, so you can test that it is installed and available to your command shell (e.g., Terminal or Git Bash) with: node --version Installing Node also installs an additional command-line program called npm. npm is a package manager, or a program used to “manage” other programs—think of it as a command-line “app store” for developer tools and libraries. npm is the most common way of installing and running a large number of tools used in professional web development. At the time of writing, the npm “registry” lists around 500,000 different packages. Managing packages with npm You can use the npm program to download and install command-line programs by name: npm install -g PACKAGE-NAME For example, you can install the live-server utility (a simple program that runs a local web server and will automatically “refresh” the browser when your code changes) using npm install -g live-server Once the program is done installing, you can run it from the command-line by using the command live-server. This program will serve all of the content from the current directory. See Chapter 2 for details. Importantly, note the included -g option. This tells npm that the package should be installed globally, making it available across the entire computer, rather than just from a particular folder. Because you want to be able to use a command-line utility like live-server from any folder (e.g., for any project), command-line utilities are always installed globally with the -g option. It is also possible to omit that option and install a package locally. For example: npm install lodash Will download the lodash code library (a set of useful JavaScript functions). This package will be placed into a new folder in the current project directory called node_modules/, and can be imported and used in the current directory’s code. (It’s called a local install because the package is only available to the “local” project). You will of course need to install local packages once per project. Because node packages can be very large, and projects can have lots of them, you want to be sure to not commit the node_modules/ folder to version control. Make sure that the folder is listed in your .gitignore file! 1.5.1 package.json As projects become large, it is common for them to build up many dependencies: packages that must be installed in order for the program to work. In other words, there needs to be a certain set of packages in the project’s node_modules/ folder. npm is able to keep track of these dependencies by recording them in a specialized file called package.json that can be placed inside the project directory. A package.json file is a text file containing a JSON list of information about your project. For example: { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;example&quot;, &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;A project with an example package.json&quot;, &quot;main&quot;: &quot;index.js&quot;, &quot;scripts&quot;: { &quot;test&quot;: &quot;jest&quot; }, &quot;author&quot;: &quot;Joel Ross&quot;, &quot;license&quot;: &quot;ISC&quot;, &quot;dependencies&quot;: { &quot;lodash&quot;: &quot;^4.17.4&quot;, &quot;moment&quot;: &quot;^2.18.1&quot; }, &quot;devDependencies&quot;: { &quot;html-validator&quot;: &quot;^2.2.2&quot; } } (You can create one of these files by using the command npm init in the current project directory, and then following the instructions to fill in the fields). Notice that there are two packages listed under &quot;dependencies&quot;: lodash and moment (the ^4.17.4 indicates which version of lodash). You can use npm to automatically install all of packages listed under &quot;dependencies&quot; (as well as &quot;devDependencies&quot;) using the command: npm install Thus using npm install without any arguments means “install all of the requirements that have been listed for this project”. This is a good first step any time you download a project or checkout a repository from GitHub. When installing specific packages, you can have npm add them to the dependencies list by using the --save option: npm install --save lodash will install lodash locally, and list it in the package.json file as a dependency. Similarly, the --save-dev option will instead save the package in the &quot;devDependencies&quot; list, which are dependencies needed only for development (writing the program’s code) and not for execution (running the program). You can uninstall packages using npm uninstall, or can remove packages from the dependencies lists simply by editing the package.json file (e.g., with VS Code). To sum up, you will use three commands with npm to install packages: npm install -g PACKAGE-NAME to globally install command-line programs npm install to locally install all of the dependencies for a project you check out npm install --save PACKAGE-NAME to locally install a new code package and record it in the package.json file. While npm is the most popular package maanger (and the one utilized in this course), there are others as well. For example, Yarn is a package manager created by Facebook that is compatible with npm and is quickly growing in popularity.

["client-side-development.html", "Chapter 2 Client-Side Development 2.1 Client-Side File Types 2.2 HTTP Requests and Servers", " Chapter 2 Client-Side Development Web development is the process of implementing (programming) web sites and applications that users can access over the internet. However, the internet is a network involving many different computers all communicating with one another. These computers can be divided into two different groups: servers store (“host”) content and provide (“serve”) it to other computers, while clients request that content and then present it to the human users. Consider the process of viewing a basic web page, such as the Wikipedia entry on Informatics. In order to visit this page, the user types the web address (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informatics) into the URL bar, or clicks on a link to go to the page. In either case, user’s computer is the client, and their browser takes that address or link and uses it to create an HTTP Request—a request for data sent following the HyperText Transfer Protocol. This request is like a letter asking for information, and is sent to a different computer: the web server that contains that information. A diagram of client/server communication. The web server will receive this request, and based on its content (e.g., where it was sent to) will decide what information to send as a response to the client. In general, this response will be made up of lots of different files: the text content of the web page, styling information (font, color) for how it should look, instructions for respond to user interaction (button clicks), images or other assets to show, and so forth. The client’s web browser will then take all of these different files in the response and use them to render the web page for the user to see: it wil determine what text to show, what font and color to make that text, where to put the images, and is ready to do something else when the user clicks on one of those images. Indeed, a web browser is just a computer program that is able to send HTTP requests on behalf of the user, and then render the resulting response. Given this interaction, client-side web development involves implementing programs (writing code) that is interpreted by the browser, and so is executed by the client. It is authoring the code that is sent in the server’s response. This code specifies how websites should appear and how the user should interact with them. On the other hand, server-side web development involves implementing programs that the server uses to determine which client-side code is delivered. As an example, a server-side program contains the logic to determine which cat picture should be sent along with the request, while a client-side program contains the logic about where and how that picture should appear on the page. This course focuses on client-side web development, or developing programs that are executed by the browser (generally as a response to a web server request). While we will cover how client-side programs can interact with a server, many of the concepts discussed here can also be run inside a browser without relying on an external server (called “running locally”). 2.1 Client-Side File Types It is the web browser’s job to interpret and render the source code files sent by a server as part of an HTTP response. As a client-side web programmer, your task is to write this source code for the browser to interpret. There are multiple different types of source code files, including: .html files containing code written in HTML (HyperText Markup Language). This code will specify the textual and semantic content of the web page. See the chapter HTML Fundamentals for details on HTML. .css files containing code written in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). This code is used to specify styling and visual appearance properties (e.g., color and font) for the HTML content. See the chapter CSS Fundamentals for details on CSS. .js files containing code written in JavaScript. This code is used to specify interactive behaviors that the website will perform—for example, what should change when the user clicks a button. Note that JavaScript code are “programs” that sent over by the web server as part of the response, but are executed on the client’s computer. See the chapter JavaScript Fundamentals for details on JavaScript. HTTP responses may also include additional asset files, such as images (.png, .jpg, .gif, etc), fonts, video or music files, etc. 2.2 HTTP Requests and Servers Modern web browsers are able to render (interpret and display) all of these types of files, combining them together into the modern, interactive web pages you use every day. In fact, you can open up almost any file inside a web browser, such as by right-clicking on the file and selecting “Open With”, or dragging the file into the browser program. HTML files act as the basis for web pages, so you can open a .html file inside your web browser by double-clicking on it (the same way you would open a .docx file in MS Word): An very simple HTML file. See Chapter 3 for source code. Consider the URL bar in the above browser. The URL (Unform Resource Locator) is actually a specialized version of a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier). URIs act a lot like the address on a postal letter sent within a large organization such as a university: you indicate the business address as well as the department and the person, and will get a different response (and different data) from Alice in Accounting than from Sally in Sales. Note that the URI is the identifier (think: variable name) for the resource, while the resource is the actual data value (the file) that you want to access. Like postal letter addresses, URIs have a very specific format used to direct the request to the right resource. The format (schema) of a URI. The parts of this URI format include: scheme (also protocol): the “language” that the computer will use to send the request for the resource (file). In the example browser window above, the protocol is file, meaning that the computer is accessing the resource from the file system. When sending requests to web servers, you would use https (secure HTTP). Don’t use insecure http! domain: the address of the web server to request information from. You can think of this as the recipient of the request letter. In the browser window example, there is no domain because the file protocol doesn’t require it. port (optional): used to determine where to connect to the web server. By default, web requests use port 80, but some web servers accept connections on other ports—e.g., 8080, 8000 and 3000 are all common on development servers, described below. path: which resource on that web server you wish to access. For the file protocol, this is the absolute path to the file. But even when using https, for many web servers, this will be the relative path to the file, starting from the “root” folder of that server (which may not be the computer’s root folder). For example, if a server used /Users/joelross/ as its root, then the path to the above HTML file would be Desktop/index.html (e.g., https://domain/Desktop/index.html). Important! If you don’t specify a path, most web servers will serve the file names index.html file from that server’s root folder (i.e., the path “defaults” to index.html). As such, this is the traditional name for the HTML file containing a websites home page. As in any program, you should always use relative paths in web programming, and these paths are frequently (but not always!) relative to the web server’s root folder. query (optional): extra parameters (arguments) included in the request about what resource to access. The leading ? is part of the query. fragment (optional): indicates which part (“fragment”) of the resource to access. This is used for example to let the user “jump” to the middle of a web page. The leading # is part of the query. Development Servers As noted above, it is possible to request a .html file (open a web page) using the file protocol by simply opening that file directly in the browser. This works fine for testing most client-side programs. However, there are a few client-side interactions that for security reasons only work if a web page is requested from a web server (e.g., via the http protocol). For this reason, it is recommended that you develop client-side web applications using a local development web server. This is a web server that you run from your own computer—your machine acts as a web server, and you use the browser to have your computer send a request to itself for the webpage. Think about mailing yourself a letter. Development web servers can help get around cross-origin request restrictions, as well as offer additional benefits to speed development—such as automatically reloading the web browser when the source code changes. There are many different ways to run a simple development server from the command-line (such as using the Python http.server module). These servers, when started, will “serve” files using the current directory as the “root” folder. So again, if you start a server from /Users/joelross, you will be able to access the Desktop/index.html file at http://127.0.0.1:port/Desktop/index.html (which port will depend on which development server you use). The address 127.0.0.1 is the IP address for localhost which is the domain of your local machine (the “local host”). Most development servers, when started, will tell you the URL for the server’s root directory. Most commonly, you will want to start the web server from the root directory of your project, so that the relative path index.html finds the file you expect. You can usually stop a command-line development server with the universal ctrl-c cancel command. Otherwise, you’ll want to leave the server running in a background terminal as long as you are working on your project. If you use the recommended live-server utility, it will open a web browser to the root folder and automatically reload the page whenever you save changes to a file in that folder. This will make your life much, much better. "],
["html-fundamentals.html", "Chapter 3 HTML Fundamentals 3.1 HTML Elements 3.2 Nesting Elements 3.3 Web Page Structure 3.4 Web Page Template Resources", " Chapter 3 HTML Fundamentals A webpage on the internet is simply a set of files that the browser renders (shows) in a particular way, allowing you to interact with it. The most basic way to control how a browser displays content (e.g., words, images, etc) is by encoding that content in HTML. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a language that is used to give meaning to otherwise plain text, which the browser can then use to determine how to display that text. HTML is not a programming language but rather a markup language): it adds additional details to information (like notes in the margin of a book), but doesn’t contain any logic. HTML is a “hypertext” markup language because it was originally intended to mark up a document with hyperlinks, or links to other documents. In modern usage, HTML describes the semantic meaning of content: it marks what content is the a heading, what content is a paragraph, what content is a definition, what content is an image, what content is a hyperlink, and so forth. HTML serves a similar function to Markdown, but is much more expressive and powerful. This chapter provides an overview and explanation of HTML’s syntax (how to use it to annotate content). HTML’s syntax is very simple, and generally only takes someone a few days to learn—though using it effectively can require more practice. 3.1 HTML Elements HTML content is normally written in .html files. By using the .html extension, your editor, computer, and browser should automatically know that this file will contain content marked up in HTML. As mentioned in Chapter 2, most web servers will by default serve a file named index.html, and so that filename is traditionally used for a website’s home page. As with all programming languages, .html files are really just plain text files with a special extension, so can be created in any text editor. However, using a coding editor such as VS Code provides additional helpful features that can speed up your development process. HTML files contain the content of your web page: the text that you want to show on the page. This content is then annotated (marked up) by surrounding it with tags: Basic syntax for an HTML element. The opening/start tag comes before the content and tell the computer “I’m about to give you content with some meaning”, while the closing/end tag comes after the content to tell the computer “I’m done giving content with that meaning.” For example, the &lt;h1&gt; tag represents a top-level heading (equivalent to one # in Markdown), and so the open tag says “here’s the start of the heading” and the closing tag says “that’s the end of the heading”. Tags are written with a less-than symbol &lt;, then the name of the tag (often a single letter), then a greater-than symbol &gt;. An end tag is written just like a start tag, but includes a forward slash / immediately after the less-than symbol—this indicates that the tag is closing the annotation. HTML tag names are not case sensitive, but you should always write them in all lowercase. Line breaks and white space around tags (including indentation) is ignored. Tags may thus be written on their own line, or inline with the content. These two uses of the &lt;p&gt; tag (which marks a paragraph of content) are equivalent: &lt;p&gt; The itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The itsy bitsy spider went up the water spout.&lt;/p&gt; Taken together, the tags and the content they contain are called an HTML Element. A website is made of a bunch of these elements. Some Example Tags The HTML standard defines lots of different elements, each of which marks a different meaning for the content. Common elements include: &lt;h1&gt;: a 1st-level heading &lt;h2&gt;: a 2nd-level heading (and so on, down to &lt;h6&gt;) &lt;p&gt;: a paragraph of text &lt;a&gt;: an “anchor”, or a hyperlink &lt;img&gt;: an image &lt;button&gt;: a button &lt;em&gt;: emphasized content. Note that this doesn’t mean italic (which is not semantic), but emphasized (which is semantic). The same as _text_ in Markdown. &lt;strong&gt;: important, strongly stated content. The same as **text** in Markdown &lt;ul&gt;: an unordered list (simil) &lt;li&gt;: a list item (an item in a list) &lt;table&gt;: a data table &lt;form&gt;: a form for the user to fill out &lt;svg&gt;: a Scalable Vector Graphic (a “coded” image) &lt;circle&gt;: a circle (in an &lt;svg&gt; element) &lt;div&gt;: a division (section) of content. Also acts as an empty block element (followed by a line break) &lt;span&gt;: a span (section) of content. Also acts as an empty inline element (not followed by a line break) Comments As with every programming language, HTML includes a way to add comments to your code. It does this by using a tag with special syntax: &lt;!-- this is a comment --&gt; &lt;p&gt;this is is not a comment&lt;/p&gt; Because that syntax is somewhat awkward to type, most source-code editors will let you comment-out the currently highlighted text by pressing cmd + / (or ctrl + / on Windows). If you’re using a code editor, try placing your cursor on a line and using that keyboard command to comment and un-comment the line. Comments can appear anywhere in the file. Just as in other languages, they are ignored by any program reading the file (with a few interesting exceptions), but they do remain in the page and are visible when you view the page source. Attributes The start tag of an element may also contain one or more attributes. These are similar to attributes in object-oriented programming: they specify properties, options, or otherwise add additional meaning to an element. Like named parameters in R or HTTP query parameters, attributes are written in the format attributeName=value; values of attributes are almost always strings, and so are written in quotes. Multiple attributes are separated by spaces: &lt;tag attributeA=&quot;value&quot; attributeB=&quot;value&quot;&gt; content &lt;/tag&gt; For example, a hyperlink anchor (&lt;a&gt;) uses a href (“hypertext reference”) attribute to specify where the content should link to: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ischool.uw.edu&quot;&gt;iSchool homepage&lt;/a&gt; In a hyperlink, the content of the tag is the displayed text, and the attribute specifies the link’s URL. Contrast this to the same link in Markdown: [iSchool homepage](https://ischool.uw.edu) Similarly, an image (&lt;img&gt;) uses the src (source) attribute to specify what picture it is showing. The alt attribute contains alternate text to use if the browser can’t show images—such as with screen readers (for the visible impaired) and search engine indexers. &lt;img src=&quot;baby_picture.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a cute baby&quot;&gt; Note that because an &lt;img&gt; has no textual content, it is an empty element (see below). There are also a number of global attributes that can be used on any element. For example: Every HTML element can include an id attribute, which is used to give them a unique identifier so that we can refer to them later (e.g., from CSS or JavaScript). id attributes are named like variable names, and must be unique on the page. &lt;h1 id=&quot;title&quot;&gt;My Web Page&lt;/h1&gt; The id attribute is most commonly used used to create “bookmark hyperlinks”, which are hyperlinks to a particular location on a page (i.e., that cause the page to scroll down). You do this by including the id as the fragment of the URI to link to (e.g., after the # in the URI). &lt;a href=&quot;index.html#nav&quot;&gt;Link to element on `index.html` with `id=&quot;nav&quot;`&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#footnote&quot;&gt;Link to element on current page with `id=&quot;footnote&quot;`&lt;/a&gt; Note that the title attribute does NOT contain the # symbol, but the URI to link to does. The lang attribute is used to indicate the language in which the element’s content is written. Programs reading this file might use that to properly index the content, correctly pronounce it via a screen reader, or even translate it into another language: &lt;p lang=&quot;sp&quot;&gt;No me gusta&lt;/p&gt; Specify the lang attribute for the &lt;html&gt; element (see below) to define the default language of the page; that way you don’t need to mark the language of every element. Always include this attribute. &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; Empty Elements A few HTML elements don’t require a closing tag because they can’t contain any content. These tags are often used for inserting media into a web page, such as with the &lt;img&gt; tag. With an &lt;img&gt; tag, you can specify the path to the image file in the src attribute, but the image element itself can’t contain additional text or other content. Since it can’t contain any content, we leave off the end tag entirely: &lt;img src=&quot;picture.png&quot; alt=&quot;description of image for screen readers and indexers&quot;&gt; Older versions of HTML (and current related languages like XML) required you to include forward slash / just before the greater-than symbol. This “end” slash indicated that the element was complete and expected no further content: &lt;img src=&quot;picture.png&quot; alt=&quot;description of image for screen readers and indexers&quot; /&gt; This is no longer required in HTML5, so feel free to omit that forward slash (though some purists, or those working with XML, will still include it). 3.2 Nesting Elements Web pages are made up of multiple (hundreds! thousands!) of HTML elements. Moreover, HTML elements can be nested: that is, the content of an HTML element can contain other HTML tags (and thus other HTML elements): An example of element nesting: the &lt;em&gt; element is nested in the &lt;h1&gt; element’s content. The semantic meaning indicated by an element applies to all its content: thus all the text in the above example is a top-level heading, and the content “(with emphasis)” is emphasized in addition. Because elements can contain elements which can themselves contain elements, an HTML document ends up being structured as a “tree” of elements: An example DOM tree (a tree of HTML elements). In an HTML document, the “root” element of the tree is always an &lt;html&gt; element. Inside this we put a &lt;body&gt; element to contain the document’s “body” (that is, the shown content): &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Hello world!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;This is &lt;em&gt;conteeeeent&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; This model of HTML as a tree of “nodes”—along with an API (programming interface) for manipulating them— is known as the Document Object Model (DOM). See Chapter: DOM for details. Caution! HTML elements have to be “closed” correctly, or the semantic meaning may be incorrect! If you forget to close the &lt;h1&gt; tag, then all of the following content will be considered part of the heading! Remember to close your inner tags before you close the outer ones. Validating your HTML can help with this. Block vs. Inline Elements All HTML elements fall into one of two categories: Block elements form a visible “block” on a page—in particular, they will be on a new line from the previous content, and any content after it will also be on a new line. These tend to be structural elements for a page: headings (&lt;h1&gt;), paragraphs (&lt;p&gt;), lists (&lt;ul&gt;), etc. &lt;div&gt;Block element&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div&gt;Block element&lt;/div&gt; Two block elements rendered on a page. Inline elements are contained “in the line” of content. These will not have a line break after them. Inline elements are used to modify the content rather than set it apart, such as giving it emphasis (&lt;em&gt;) or declaring that it to be a hyperlink (&lt;a&gt;). &lt;span&gt;Inline element&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Other inline element&lt;/span&gt; Two inline elements rendered on a page. Inline elements go inside of block elements, and it’s common to put block elements inside of the other block elements (e.g., an &lt;li&gt; inside of a &lt;ul&gt;, or a &lt;p&gt; inside of a &lt;div&gt;). However, it is invalid to to nest a block element inside of an inline element—the content won’t make sense, and probably won’t look right. Some elements have further restrictions on nesting. For example, a &lt;ul&gt; (unordered list) is only allowed to contain &lt;li&gt; elements—anything else is invalid markup. 3.3 Web Page Structure Now that you understand how to specify HTML elements, you can begin making real web pages! However, there are a few more tags you need to know and include for a valid, modern web page. Doctype Declaration All HTML files start with a document type declaration, commonly referred to as the “Doctype.” This tells the rendering program (e.g., the browser) what format and syntax your document is using. Since you’re writing pages with HTML 5, you can declare it as follows: &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; ... &lt;/html&gt; &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; isn’t technically an HTML tag (it’s actally XML). While modern browsers will perform a “best guess” as to the Doctype, it is best practice to specify it explicitly. Always include the DOCTYPE at the start of your HTML files! ### The Section {-} In addition to the &lt;body&gt; element that defines the displayed content, you should also include a &lt;head&gt; element that acts as the document “header” (the &lt;head&gt; is nested inside the &lt;html&gt; at the same level as the &lt;body&gt;). The content of the &lt;head&gt; element is not shown on the web page—instead it provides extra (meta) information about the document being rendered. There are a couple of common elements you should include in the &lt;head&gt;: A &lt;title&gt;, which specifies the “title” of the webpage: &lt;title&gt;My Page Title&lt;/title&gt; Browsers will show the page title in the tab at the top of the browser window, and use that as the default bookmark name if you bookmark the page. But the title is also used by search indexers and screen readers for the blind, since it often provides a strong signal about what the page’s subject. Thus your title should be informative and reflective of the content. A &lt;meta&gt; tag that specifies the character encoding of the page: &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt; The &lt;meta&gt; tag itself represents “metadata” (information about the page’s data), and uses an attribute and value to specify that information. The most important &lt;meta&gt; tag is for the character set, which tells the browser how to convert binary bits from the server into letters. Nearly all editors these days will save files in the UTF-8 character set, which supports the mixing of different scripts (Latin, Cyrillic, Chinese, Arabic, etc) in the same file. You can also use the &lt;meta&gt; tag to include more information about the author, description, and keywords for your page: &lt;meta name=&quot;author&quot; content=&quot;your name&quot;&gt; &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;description of your page&quot;&gt; &lt;meta name=&quot;keywords&quot; content=&quot;list,of,keywords,separate,by,commas&quot;&gt; Note that the name attribute is used to specify the “variable name” for that piece of metadata, while the content attribute is used to specify the “value” of that metadata. &lt;meta&gt; elements are empty elements and have no content of their own. Again, these are not visible in the browser window (because they are in the &lt;head&gt;!), but will be used by search engines to index your page. At the very least, always include author information for the pages you create! We will discuss additional elements for the &lt;head&gt; section throughout the text, such as using &lt;link&gt; to include CSS and using &lt;script&gt; to include JavaScript. 3.4 Web Page Template Putting this all together produces the following “template” for making a web page: &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt; &lt;meta name=&quot;author&quot; content=&quot;your name&quot;&gt; &lt;meta name=&quot;description&quot; content=&quot;description of your page&quot;&gt; &lt;title&gt;My Page Title&lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; ... Content goes here! ... &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; You can use this to start off every web page you ever create from now on!

["css-fundamentals.html", "Chapter 5 CSS Fundamentals 5.1 Why Two Different Languages? 5.2 CSS Rules 5.3 The Cascade", " Chapter 5 CSS Fundamentals CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a declarative language used to alter the appearance or styling of a web page. CSS is used to define a set of formatting rules, which the browser applies when it renders your page. Thus CSS can tell the browser to use a particular font for the page text, a certain color for the first paragraph in an article, or a picture for the page’s background. Files of CSS rules (called stylesheets) thus act kind of like Styles or Themes in PowerPoint, but are way more powerful. You can control nearly every aspect of an element’s appearance, including its overall placement on the page. To give you some idea of just how much control you have, check out the examples in the CSS Zen Garden. Every one of those examples uses the exact same HTML page, but they all look completely different because each one uses a different CSS stylesheet. This chapter will explain how to include CSS in your web page and the overall syntax for declaring basic CSS rules. Additional details and options can be found in the following chapter 5.1 Why Two Different Languages? If you are new to web programming, you might be wondering why there are two different languages: HTML for your page content; and CSS for formatting rules. Why not just include the formatting right in with the content? There is an old, tried-and-true principle in programming referred to as “separation of concerns”. Well-designed software keeps separate things separate, so that it’s easy to change one without breaking the other. And one of the most common forms of separation is to keep the data (content) in a program separate from the presentation (appearance) of that data. By separating content (the HTML) from its appearance (the CSS), you get a number of benefits: The same content can easily be presented in different ways (like in the CSS Zen Garden). In web development, you could allow the user to choose different “themes” for a site, or you could change the formatting for different audiences (e.g., larger text for vision-impaired users, more compact text for mobile users, or different styles for cultures with different aesthetic sensibilities). You can have several HTML pages to all share the same CSS stylesheet, allowing you to change the look of an entire web site by only editing one file. This is an application of the Don’t Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle. You can also dynamically adjust the look of your page by applying new style rules to elements in response to user interaction (clicking, hovering, scrolling, etc.) Users who don’t care about about the visual appearance (e.g., blind users with screen readers, automated web indexers) can more quickly and effectively engage with the content without needing to determine what information is “content” and what is just “aesthetics”. Good programming style in web development thus keeps the semantics (HTML) separate from the appearance (CSS). Your HTML should simply describe the meaning of the content, not what it looks like! For example, while browsers might normally show &lt;em&gt; text as italic, we can use CSS to instead make emphasized text underlined, highlighted, larger, flashing, or with some other appearance. The &lt;em&gt; says nothing about the visual appearance, just that the text is emphatic, and it’s up to the styling to determine how that emphasis should be conveyed visually. 5.2 CSS Rules While it’s possible to write CSS rules directly into HTML, the best practice is to create a separate CSS stylesheet file and connect that to your HTML content. These files are named with the .css extension, and are typically put in a css/ folder in web page’s project directory, as with the following folder structure: my-project/ |-- css/ |-- style.css |-- index.html (style.css, main.css, and index.css are all common names for the “main” stylesheet). You connect the stylesheet to your HTML by adding a &lt;link&gt; element to your page’s &lt;head&gt; element: &lt;head&gt; &lt;!--... other elements here...--&gt; &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;css/style.css&quot;&gt; &lt;/head&gt; The &lt;link&gt; element represents a connection to another resource. The tag includes an attribute indicating the relation between the resources (e.g., that the linked file is a stylesheet). The href attribute should be a relative path from the .html file to the .css resource. Note also that a &lt;link&gt; is an empty element so has no closing tag. Overall Syntax A CSS stylesheet lists rules for formatting particular elements in an HTML page. The basic syntax looks like: /* this is pseudocode for a CSS rule */ selector { property: value; property: value; } /* this would be another, second rule */ selector { property: value; } A CSS rule rule starts with a selector, which specifies which elements the rule applies to. The selector is followed by a pair of braces {}, inside of which is a set of formatting properties. Properties are made up of the property name (e.g., color), followed by a colon (:), followed by a value to be assigned to that property (e.g., purple). Each name-value pair must end with a semi-colon (;). If you forget the semi-colon, the browser will likely ignore the property and any subsequent properties—and it does so silently without showing an error in the developer tools! Like most programming languages, CSS ignores new lines and whitespace. However, most developers will use the styling shown above, with the brace on the same line as the selector and indented properties. As a concrete example, the below rule applies to any h1 elements, and makes them appear in the ‘Helvetica’ font as white text on a dark gray background: h1 { font-family: &#39;Helvetica&#39;; color: white; background-color: #333; /*dark gray*/ } Note that CSS comments are written using the same block-comment syntax used in Java (/* a comment */), but cannot be written using inline-comment syntax (//a comment). When you modify a CSS file, you will need to reload the page in your browser to see the changed appearance. If you are using a program such as live-server, this reloading should happen automatically! CSS Properties There are many, many different CSS formatting properties you can use to style HTML elements. All properties are specified using the name:value syntax described above—the key is to determine the name of the property that produces the appearance you want, and then provide a valid value for that property. Pro-tip: modern editors such as VS Code will provide auto-complete suggestions for valid property names and values. Look carefully at those options to discover more! Below is a short list of common styling properties you may change with CSS; more complex properties and their usage is described in the following chapter. font-family: the “font” of the text (e.g., 'Comic Sans'). Font names containing white space must be put in quotes (single or double), and I tend to quote any specific font name as well. Note that the value for the font-family property can also be a comma-separated list of fonts, with the browser picking the first item that is available on that computer: /* pick Helvetic Nue if exists, else Helvetica, else Arial, else the default sans-serif font */ font-family: &#39;Helvetica Nue&#39;, &#39;Helvetica&#39;, &#39;Arial&#39;, sans-serif; font-size: the size of the text (e.g., 12px to be 12 pixels tall). The value must include units (so 12px, not 12). See the next chapter for details on Units &amp; Sizes. font-weight: boldness (e.g., bold, or a numerical value such as 700). color: text color (e.g., either a named color like red or a hex value like #4b2e83. See the next chapter for details on colors. The background-color property specifies the background color for the element. border: a border for the element (see “Box Model” in the next chapter). Note that this is a short-hand property which actually sets multiple related properties at once. The value is thus an ordered list of values separated by spaces: /* border-width should be 3px, border-style should be dashed, and border-color should be red */ border: 3px dashed red; Read the documentation for an individual property to determine what options are available! Note that not all properties or values be effectively or correctly supported by all browers. Be sure and check the browser compatibility listings! CSS Selectors Selectors are used to “select” which HTML elements the css rule should apply to. As with properties, there are many different kinds of selectors (and see the following chapter), but there are three that are most common: Element Selector The most basic selector, the element selector selects elements by their element (tag) name. For example, the below rule will apply the all &lt;p&gt; elements, regardless of where they appear on the page: p { color: purple; } You can also use this to apply formatting rules to the entire page by selecting the &lt;body&gt; element. Note that for clarity/speed purposes, we generally do not apply formatting to the &lt;html&gt; element. body { background-color: black; color: white; } Class Selector Sometimes you want a rule to apply to only some elements of a particular type. You will most often do this by using a class selector. This rule will select elements with a class attribute that contains the specified name. For example, if you had HTML: &lt;!-- HTML --&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;highlighted&quot;&gt;This text is highlighted!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This text is not highlighted&lt;/p&gt; You could color just the correct paragraph by using the class selector: /* CSS */ .highlighted { background-color: yellow; } Class selectors are written with a single dot (.) preceding the name of the class (not the name of the tag!) The . is only used in the CSS rule, not in the HTML class attribute. Class selectors also let us apply a single, consistent styling to multiple different types of elements: &lt;!-- HTML --&gt; &lt;h1 class=&quot;alert-flashing&quot;&gt;I am a flashing alert!&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;alert-flashing&quot;&gt;So am I!&lt;p&gt; CSS class names should start with a letter, and can contain hyphens, underscores, and numbers. Words are usually written in lowercase and separated by hyphens rather than camelCased. Note that HTML elements can contain multiple classes; each class name is separate by a space: &lt;p class=&quot;alert flashing&quot;&gt;I have TWO classes: &quot;alert&quot; and &quot;flashing&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;alert-flashing&quot;&gt;I have ONE class: &quot;alert-flashing&quot;&lt;/p&gt; The class selector will select any element that contains that class in its list. So the first paragraph in the above example would be selected by either .alert OR .flashing. You should always strive to give CSS classes semantic names that describe the purpose of element, rather than just what it looks like. highlighted is a better class name than just yellow, because it tells you what you’re styling (and will remain sensible even if you change the styling later). Overall, seek to make your class names informative, so that your code is easy to understand and modify later. There are also more formal methodologies for naming classes that you may wish to utilize, the most popular of which is BEM (Block, Element, Modifier). Class selectors are often commonly used with &lt;div&gt; (block) and &lt;span&gt; (inline) elements. These HTML elements have no semantic meaning on their own, but can be given appearance meaning through their class attribute. This allows them to “group” content together for styling: &lt;div class=&quot;cow&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moo moo moo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Moooooooooooooooooooo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;sheep&quot;&gt; &lt;p&gt;Baa baa &lt;span class=&quot;dark&quot;&gt;black&lt;/span&gt; sheep, have you any wool?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; 5.2.0.1 Id Selector It is also possible to select HTML elements by their id attribute by using an id selector. Every HTML element can have an id attribute, but unlike the class attribute the value of the id must be unique within the page. That is, no two elements can have the same value for their id attributes. Id selectors start with a # sign, followed by the value of the id: &lt;div id=&quot;sidebar&quot;&gt; This div contains the sidebar for the page &lt;/div&gt; /* the one element with id=&quot;sidebar&quot; */ #sidebar { background-color: lightgray; } The id attribute is more specific (it’s always just one element!) but less flexible than the class attribute, and makes it harder to “reuse” your styling across multiple elements or multiple pages. Thus you should almost always use a class selector instead, unless you are referring to a single, specific element. 5.3 The Cascade CSS is called Cascading Style Sheets because multiple rules can apply to the same element (in a “cascade” of style!) CSS rules are additive—if multiple rules apply to the same element, the browser will combine all of the style properties when rendering the content: /* CSS */ p { /* applies to all paragraphs */ font-family: &#39;Helvetica&#39; } .alert { /* applies to all with class=&quot;alert&quot; */ font-size: larger; } .success { /* applies to all with class=&quot;success&quot; */ color: #28a745; /* a pleasant green */ } &lt;!-- HTML --&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;alert success&quot;&gt; This paragraph will be in Helvetica font, a larger font-size, and green color, because all 3 of the above rules apply to it. &lt;/p&gt; CSS styling apply to all of the content in an element. And since that content can contain other elements that may have their own style rules, rules may also in effect be inherited: &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- has own styling --&gt; &lt;div class=&quot;sub-sec&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- has own styling + .content styling --&gt; &lt;ol class=&quot;demo-list&quot;&gt; &lt;!-- own styling (ol AND .demo-list rules) + .sub-sec + .content --&gt; &lt;!-- li styling + .demo-list + .sub-sec + .content --&gt; &lt;li&gt;Item 1&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Item 2&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Item 3&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; Important! Rules are applied in the order they are defined in the CSS file. If you link multiple CSS files to the same page, the files are processed in order they are linked in the HTML. The browser selects elements that match the rule and applies the rule’s property. If a later rule selects the same element and applies a different value to that property, the previous value is overridden. So in general, all things being equal, the last rule on the page wins. /* two rules, both alike in specificity */ p { color: red; } p { color: blue; } &lt;p&gt;This text will be blue, because that rule comes last!&lt;/p&gt; However, there are some exceptions when CSS treats rules as not equal and favors earlier rules over later ones. This is called Selector Specificity. In general, more specific selectors (#id) take precedence over less specific ones (.class, which is more specific than tag). If you notice that one of your style rules is not being applied, despite your syntax being correct, check your browser’s developer tools to see if your rule is being overridden by a more specific rule in an earlier stylesheet. Then adjust your selector so that it has the same or greater specificity. .alert { color: red; } div { color: blue; } &lt;div class=&quot;alert&quot;&gt;This text will be red, even though the `div` selector is last, because the `.alert` selector has higher specificity so is not overridden.&lt;/div&gt; Precedence rules are not a reason to prefer #id selectors over .class selectors! Instead, you can utilize the more complex selectors described in the next chapter to be able to create reusable rules an avoid duplicating property declarations.
